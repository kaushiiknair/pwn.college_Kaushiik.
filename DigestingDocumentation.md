# Learning Complex Usage
For this challenge we use the /challenge/challenge --printfile /challenge/DESCRIPTION.md command to first print out the description
and then simply use the same command but append the end with flag which should give us the result as the goal for this challenge
is just to ensure that we know how to present arguements which are complex

The flag for the above challenge is pwn.college{4uDo0CjK-L6VW9qEoYxzzKyIv-O.QX1ITO0wCN1AzNzEzW}


# Reading Manuals
In this challenge, we are using the man command which is short for manual. It gives us all sorts of information which would be related
to how some things work on the command terminal. We first use man challenge and rhen from there we get the secret optiion which is
vbuhup 485 to access the flag. We use it as /challenge/challenge --vbuhup 485.

# Searching Manuals
In this challenge, we use the command "man challenge" to go and find the flag using the / command which helps us in finding the flag by inputting /flag. Then it shows us that --gry gives the output of the flag and then we use /challenge/challenge --gry to obtain the flag after clicking q to escape from the manual
